# Creating an issue

When reporting bugs keep in mind that the people working on it do this unpaid, in their free time and as a hobby. So be
polite and helpful. Bug reports that demand, contain insults to this or other projects, or have a general unfriendly
tone will be closed without discussion. Everybody has it own way of working; What might be the norm for you, might not
be for others. Therefore be verbose in your description.

Before creating an issue:

* Update to the latest version. Check if problem still exists.
* Check existing bug reports, see if it is already reported.
* Read the documentation. Make sure the behaviour you are seeing is a bug.

When reporting bugs include the following information:

* Rofi version. rofi -v
* Rofi configuration. rofi -help (in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/))
* Steps to reproduce.
* What behaviour you see.
* What behaviour you expect to see.
* A proper title for others to search for.
* Be exact.

The issue tracker is not for:

* Questions. 
* Writing complaints.

These topics belong on [FORUM](https://forum.qtools.org/), [IRC](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#rofi),
frequently asked questions will be added to the [F.A.Q](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi/wiki#faq) on the
[wiki](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi/wiki).

Questions filled in on the bug tracker will be marked `question`, locked and closed. If the question is clear, I
normally try to provide an answer.
